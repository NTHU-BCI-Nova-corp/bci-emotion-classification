<h1>BCI - Emotion - Classification </h1>
<p> <strong>Authors:</strong> Ernesto, Alex, Novo</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this project we replicated the data preprocessing of 3 emotional states (concentrated, relaxed, and neutral states) obtained from the Dataset
used by Jordan et. al in "Mental Emotional Sentiment Classification with an EEG-based Brain-Machine Interface". We demonstrate that it is possible
to achieve a high classification accuracy using his preprocessing technique which consists in creating a defined set of statistical features
plus FFT windows based on 4 channels with the commercial Muse EEG headband.

Furthermore, we also download a special dataset named Seed IV, and try to replicate the findings in this new dataset.
